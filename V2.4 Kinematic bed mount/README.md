## Test results
I used [whoppingpochard's measure_thermal_behavior.py script](https://github.com/tanaes/measure_thermal_behavior) to measure performance with the stock bed mounting and this mod. I also installed extrusion backers together with this mod but it should not affect significantly the plots shown below.
